A beautiful web application for tracking your cryptocurrency holdings.
It is a light `php` application that you can setup easily on your local computer and deploy it on your server.
If you have invested some crypto for your friends or family, it is a great way to keep them informed üë®‚Äçüíª.

### Setup
You can setup your portfolio in two ways.
The first by manually editing `data.json` . Add a crypto - balance pair under portfolio, and make the password an empty string to gain access.
The second way is to use `create-portfolio.php` script which will walk you though the setup. But it requires you to have `php` installed.

```
php create_portfolio.php
```

I have used www.cryptocompare.com as an API provider. It is a third party service. You may have to signup for using their services.

After setting it up you are ready to upload it to your server or use it locally.
For you financial privacy, You can make sure that only `/public` folder is accessible from your server provider.
